# Spotify Search

This is a simple project that displays the most popular Spotify search result based on the search term entered along with the embedded Spotify track.

The colour scheme changes based on the prominent colours in the song's album track.

If no song is found, then a "Track Not Found" error is displayed.

# Motivation

This project was mainly created as a way for me to learn about APIs as well as to get more familiar with JavaScript. The Spotify API is the core of this project.
